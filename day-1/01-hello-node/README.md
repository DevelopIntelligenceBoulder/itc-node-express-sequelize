2. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:

   - Within the `HelloNode` directory, initialize a new Node.js project:
     ```
     npm init -y
     ```

3. **Create Your First Script**:

   - Create a file named `index.js`.
   - Open it in your favorite text editor and add the following JavaScript code:
     ```javascript
     console.log('Hello, Node.js!')
     ```

4. **Run Your Application**:

   - Back in your terminal, run the script with Node.js:
     ```
     node index.js
     ```

   You should see the output: `Hello, Node.js!`
