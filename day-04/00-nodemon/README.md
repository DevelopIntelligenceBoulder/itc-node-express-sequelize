# Using Nodemon in Node.js Projects

## Introduction
`nodemon` is a utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server. This is particularly useful in development environments.

## Step 1: Install Nodemon
Install `nodemon` as a development dependency in your Node.js project:

```bash
npm install nodemon --save-dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Start Script
To use `nodemon`, you need to add a script in your `package.json` file to start your application. This allows you to start your application with `nodemon` instead of `node`.

### Updating the `package.json` File
Add a start script to your `package.json` under the `scripts` section:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon your-app.js"
}
```

Replace `your-app.js` with the entry point file of your Node.js application.

## Step 3: Run Your Application
With `nodemon` configured, you can start your application using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
