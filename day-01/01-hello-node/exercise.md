# Exercise: Hello Node

## Objective
Ensure students can run a Node.js program, verifying their setup and familiarizing themselves with executing JavaScript code with Node.js.

## Task
Write and execute a simple Node.js script that prints "Hello, Node!" to the console.

## Instructions
1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. You can verify this by running `node -v` in your command line or terminal, which should display the version of Node.js installed.

2. **Create Your Script**:
   - Create a new text file named `helloNode.js`.
   - Open the file in a text editor suitable for code, such as VSCode, Atom, or even a simple editor like Notepad or TextEdit.

3. **Write the Script**:
   - Add the following line of JavaScript code to your `helloNode.js` file:
     ```javascript
     console.log('Hello, Node!')
     ```

4. **Run Your Script**:
   - Open your command line or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory containing your `helloNode.js` file.
   - Execute the script by running:
     ```bash
     node helloNode.js
     ```
   - Verify that "Hello, Node!" is printed to the console.
