# Introduction to Express and Sequelize Integration

## Overview

In this lesson, we will learn about combining Express and Sequelize to build a RESTful API. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Benefits of Combining Express and Sequelize

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Express handles the routing and middleware, while Sequelize manages the database interactions.
2. **Scalability**: Both Express and Sequelize are designed to handle large applications with ease.
3. **Flexibility**: You can easily add new routes and models as your application grows.

## Setting Up the Project

We will start by setting up a new Node.js project and installing the necessary dependencies.

### Steps

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:

```bash
mkdir express-sequelize-demo
cd express-sequelize-demo
npm init -y
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install express sequelize mysql2
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we introduced the concept of combining Express and Sequelize to build a RESTful API. We also set up a new Node.js project and installed the necessary dependencies.
